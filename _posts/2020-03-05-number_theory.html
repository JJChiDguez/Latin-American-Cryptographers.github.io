        <p>I always liked mathematics and logic. During my undergrad degree, I spent hours
          devouring anything written by Wittgenstein, and finding about Cantor and
          Gödel (in contrast to my high school years in which I obsessed with Nietzsche and
          Camus, and even read the whole 'Phenomenology of the Spirit' by Hegel to see
          where Nietzsche was coming from)<sup><a href="#foot1">[1]</a></sup>.
          I also read anything from Jorge Luis Borges as his literature writing touch
          upon some mathematical concepts, while also deeply loving the way Borges writes.
          At the end, I studied them from a more philosophical perspective, as my degree was
          touching upon that, but I always dreamt on studying mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>Getting access to these books and articles from these authors and more was always
          difficult as I didn't have any money to buy them, so I spent hours in public libraries
          reading them. Some books also never reached my country, Ecuador, so sometimes
          I had to find the only copy in the country that some professor had and ask them
          to lend them to me for a time. I remember that once I wanted to read an specific
          book by Derrida and I found that one professor had it but in it's original french.
          My french is not the best but I succeeded in reading it, even when Derrida
          plays with the french language and basically deconstructs it. I'm also a woman,
          so sometimes I had to hide that I was reading something as 'women are not
          supposed to read that'.
        </p>
        <p>Some weeks ago, I had a very nice call with Steven Galbraith, and my interest
          for mathematics got renewed. So I decided to do what I do best: find books
          and read them.
        </p>
        <p>The subsequent posts I will writing are the results of me reading <em>A Classical
            Introduction to Modern Number Theory'</em> by Kenneth Ireland and
          Michael Rosen, <em>'An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'</em> by Ivan Nevin, Herbert
          S. Zuckerman and Hugh L. Montgomery, and <em>'Introduction to Automata Theory,
            Languages and Computation'</em> by John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani and
          Jeffrey D. Ullman. In the future, I'll be also reading <em>'Logical Foundations of
            Proof Complexity'</em> by Stephen Cook, <em>'Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number
            Theory'</em> by Daniel Shanks, <em>'The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves'</em> and <em>'Advanced
              Topics in the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves'</em> by Joseph H. Silverman.
        </p>
        <p>As the book <em>'A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory'</em> states,
          "L. Kronecker once remarked (speaking of mathematics generally) that God made
          the natural numbers and all the rest is the work of man". Number Theory is
          precisely the study of natural numbers, also called the positive integers
          (although, some definitions begin the natural numbers with the '0'). Properties
          of these numbers have been studied for a very long time, and today we will be
          looking at divisibility.
        </p>
        <p>A number <code>a</code>, not zero, is said to divide another <code>b</code> if there is a
          number <code>c</code> such that <code>b = ac</code>. We write this: <code>a|b</code>.
        </p>
        <p>For example, <code>a = 3</code>, <code>b = 6</code>: <code>6 = 3 * 2</code>.</p>
        <p>This simple definition of division can be further examined by listing it's
          properties:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><code>a|b</code> implies <code>a|bc</code> for any integer <code>c</code>,</li>
          <li><code>a|b</code> and <code>b|c</code> imply <code>a|c</code>,</li>
          <li><code>a|b</code> and <code>a|c</code> imply <code>a|(bx + cy)</code> for any integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,</li>
          <li><code>a|b</code> and <code>b|a</code> imply <code>a = ±b</code>,</li>
          <li><code>a|b</code>, <code>a > 0</code>, <code>b > 0</code>, imply <code>a ≤ b</code>,</li>
          <li> if <code>m ≠ 0</code>, <code>a|b</code> implies and is implied by <code>ma|mb</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of these properties are a theorem and should be proven, as they have already
          in the past. Why is a proof important? A proof is a inferential argument<sup><a href="#foot2">[2]</a></sup>
          showing that an assumption logically guarantees a conclusion. Sometimes just
          finding an example is enough to provide a proof of a theorem, for example: "there
          is a positive number that is not the sum of three squares" can be proven by
          noting that 7 is such a number. But other statements are harder to proof.
        </p>
        <p>In software programming, one might say that is enough to run a program to
          see that it works: but, most of the times, you cannot run a program on
          every possible input that will be given. That is why proofs are needed.
        </p>
        <p>There are many methods for providing a proof: direct proof, proof by
          contradiction, proof by contraposition, proof by construction, inductive proofs
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>Returning to the idea of divisibility: If we are given a number, it is tempting
          to factor it again until further factorization is impossible. Numbers that
          cannot be factored any further are called primes. An integer <code>p > 1</code> is a prime
          number in case there is no divisor <code>d</code> of <code>p</code> satisfying <code>1 &lt; d &lt; p</code>. If an
              integer <code>a &gt; 1</code> is not a prime, it is called a composite.
        </p>
        <p>When one looks at primes one can ask: can every even number greater than 2 be
          written as the sum of two primes? This is known as the Goldbach conjecture,
          which has not yet been proven. This problem belongs to the 'additive' problems
          around primes, but we must look at another problem in the 'multiplicative'
          ones that has been proven:
        </p>

        <h2>Theorem</h2>
        <p>Every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes.</p>

        <h2>Proof</h2>
        <p>If the given integer <code>n</code> is a prime, then the integer itself stands as a product
          with a single factor.
        </p>
        <p>If the given integer <code>n</code> is not a prime, then it can be factored into <code>n_1 * n_2</code>.
          If <code>n_1</code> is not a prime, then it can be factored into <code>n_3 * n_4</code>. The same for
          <code>n_2</code>. This process of writing each composite as a product of factors will
          end at some point when the factors are smaller than the composite itself, and
          each factor is an integer greater than 1.
        </p>
        <p>We can provide a proof by contradiction for this as well:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>We rewrite the statement as 'If an integer is greater than 1 then it can
            be expressed as a product of primes'.</li>
          <li>We construct the contradiction ("H and not C implies falsehood"):
            'If an integer is greater than 1 then it cannot be expressed as a product of
            primes'.</li>
          <li>Define <code>N = an integer greater than 1 that cannot be expressed as product of
              primes</code>. <code>N</code> cannot be a prime, as it will stand as a product with a single
            factor. Therefore <code>N = n*m</code>, where <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are positive and smaller than
            <code>N</code>. As either <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> is bigger than 1, then it should be expressed as
            a product. This arrives to a contradiction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Canonically, this can be worded as:</p>

        <!-- a relevant quote in the article -->
        <blockquote class="article-quote">
          Every positive integer <code>n > 1</code> can be represented in exactly one way as a product
          of prime powers:
        </blockquote>

        <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22f8cf10ecd16a6f7dc6d97338d84be9c369a3f7" alt="product of prime powers">

        <p>The representation of <code>n</code> as a product of primes is called the canonical
          factoring of <code>n</code> into prime powers. Gauss was the first to provide a proof
          for this, and it is defined as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Notably
          in algebraic number theory, unique factorization fails to hold. An example of
          this can be easily seen in this example:
        </p>
        <p>Let's consider <code>S</code> the class of positive integers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10...) and only
          those. <code>S</code> is a multiplicative system in that the product of any two
          elements on it is found on <code>S</code> as well. Then <code>8 = 4 * 2</code> is a "composite", as
          the factors exist in the group; on the contrary, <code>10</code> is a "prime" as there are
          no factors on <code>S</code> that factor it. The number 60 has two factorings into "primes":
          <code>60 = 2 * 30</code> and <code>60 = 6 * 10</code>. Factorization is, therefore, not unique in this
          case. This can be extended to other classes as well.
        </p>
        <p>This is an small summary of reading the first chapters of the listed books.
          Up next, we will look more at unique factorization, the binomial theorem.
          We will also look at Finite Automata on a different post.
        </p>

        <h2>Fascinating things I learned</h2>

        <p>If <code>g</code> is the greatest common divisor of <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, then there exists
          integers <code>x_0</code> and <code>y_0</code> such that <code>g = (b, c) = bx_0 + cy_0</code>, which
          means that the g.c.d of two integers <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> is expressible as a linear
          combination of <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> with integral multipliers <code>x_0</code> and <code>y_0</code>.
          This is simply beautiful.
