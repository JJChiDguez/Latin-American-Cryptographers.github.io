  <h1 class="article-title">Criptolatin Workshop:</h1>
  <h2>The Latin American community of cryptographers (CLW)</h2>
</div>
<div class="article-text">
  <p><strong>Location</strong>: Special event with <a href="https://www.urosario.edu.co/Latin-Crypt/inicio/">LatinCrypt 2021</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Date</strong>: 9th October, 2021.</p>
  <p><strong>Organizers</strong>: Abdelraham Aly, Gustavo Banegas, Fabio Campos, Sofía Celi, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Daniel Escudero, Octavio Perez Kempner, Fernando Virdia, and Arantxa Zapico.</p>
  <br>
  <p><a href="https://www.criptolatino.org/">Criptolatino</a> is a community of the Latinamerican cryptographers focused on creating a welcoming community for anyone on Latin America wanting to pursue the study and work of cryptography.</p>
  <p>With the above in mind, we aimed to create this workshop as an event where people who are interested in cryptography in Latin America can learn more about it: from the experiences of Latin Americans working in the academia and in the industry.
    We want to share with them what we work on, the topics we study and the challenges of being a Latin American in this field.</p>
  <p>The idea of the event is to present various panels of senior Latin American cryptographers where they share the challenges, successes and their current work. We will also have presentations explaining what cryptography is (from a mathematical,
    electrical engineering, software development and cryptanalysis perspective) and short presentations of the work that we currently do. The goal is that participants feel encouraged to start working in this field and understand what it means to be
    a Latin American cryptographer. By introducing our community and inviting world-class Latin American researchers to present their work and experience, we hope that students and participants with little experience feel more encouraged to get
    involved in the field. Hence, our main goal is to provide a grasp on the alternatives that people from Latinamerica can have to pursue a career in cryptography.</p>

  <p><strong>The Event:</strong></p>
  <p>The event will be entirely virtual. We will be using Zoom and GatherTown.</p>
  <p>Be aware that it is not a place for people to be exclusionary. We’ll use the <a href="https://snapl.org/2015/policy.html">SNAPL Friendly Environment Policy</a>, and follow all the guidelines and policies of the LatinCrypt2021 conference.</p>
  <p>The schedule will follow this format (all times are displayed in UTC):</p>

  <p>The socializing times can be used for us to meet each other, come up with new ideas or propose paths to explore.</p>

  <p><strong>Registration:</strong></p>
  <p>Registration is free; but you must be aware of the SNAPL Friendly Environment Policy.</p>
  <p>We require that every participant represent themselves by the name that they use for their professional work (this can be a pseudonym that they generally use for their professional work). No participant can impersonate another person.</p>
